                <p>
                    To some it was becoming an astronaut, to others maybe an engineer, sport star, doctor, web-developer, so many different callings in life for one to choose that a person could spend their whole life trying to find theirs. Yet Ever since James was old enough to bear the weight of a hammer in his hand he knew what he was meant for.</br>Whether it's his knees planted in the soil with mud under his fingernails or slicing and dicing a recently chopped tree into his mind's creation, James's natural state is at work. Unwittingly James has acquired 20 years worth of knowledge in this line of work without even realising he was doing so, not in the hopes of financial gain or for any one specific job, but for the deep satisfaction create something with nothing but his own skills and know-how.</br>JOL services is dedicated to supplying our clients with the best service and attention to detail possible and will treat every garden, project and person as though they are the sole focus of the business.
